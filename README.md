# ftrl-data
Scripts to process ridership data from LTA's Datamall.

- In time to come I want to see if I can do something more with this. Maybe a page showing busiest travel routes or something?
- Might write about this on the blog someday. For now, though, I'm biding my time...

In the interest of size, the processed data on these scripts are no longer on Github - they're now on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aJWB2UMqHtL7dxJkweEXZZbNodJg6pAf?usp=sharing). They are released under the Singapore Open Data License. They're the same data that's available from Datamall, just run through the scripts in this repository.

Format of said processed data contains the same fields as you'll find in the LTA's documentation.

The exception is the byhour sheet, which has been converted into an easy-to-see chart layout. Header names remain the same though.

Scripts are also available for processing of bus data, again obtained from LTA Datamall, and the outputs are in the Google Drive (link above)
